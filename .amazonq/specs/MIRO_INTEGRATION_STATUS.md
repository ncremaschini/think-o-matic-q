# Miro Integration Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### Backend Implementation
- **MiroService** (`server/src/services/miro.ts`)
  - Cookie-based authentication using existing cookies.txt
  - Board creation from workshop data
  - Template mapping for different workshop types
  - Content addition (sticky notes with workshop info)
  - Board content retrieval for analysis

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/workshops/:id/create-miro-board` - Creates Miro board for workshop
- `POST /api/workshops/:id/analyze` - Analyzes workshop content from Miro board

### Frontend Integration
- **WorkshopCard** updated with Miro functionality
  - "Create Board" button for agenda-approved workshops
  - "Analyze" button for workshops with Miro boards
  - "Open Board" button to access Miro boards directly
  - Miro board link display in workshop details

### Environment Configuration
- Miro credentials properly configured in `.env`:
  - `MIRO_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Your access token
  - `MIRO_REFRESH_TOKEN` - Your refresh token  
  - `MIRO_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID` - Your workspace ID
  - Template IDs for different workshop types

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Direct API Testing
- ✅ Miro API connection verified (can list boards, create boards)
- ✅ Board creation works with simple data
- ⚠️ Server integration has debugging enabled but needs final testing

### Workshop Flow
1. ✅ Create workshop
2. ✅ Generate/approve agenda  
3. 🔄 Create Miro board (implemented, needs testing)
4. 🔄 Analyze workshop content (implemented, needs testing)

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Miro Templates Available
- Brainstorming: `uXjVI1oEMo0=`
- Retrospective: `uXjVI1v8YqU=`
- Planning: `uXjVI1v0Pys=`

### Authentication Method
- Using cookie-based auth from `../cookies.txt`
- Access token as backup authentication
- No OAuth flow needed (perfect for local development)

## 🚀 Ready to Use

The Miro integration is fully implemented and ready for testing:

1. **Start the servers**: `npm run dev` (starts both backend and frontend)
2. **Create a workshop** in the UI
3. **Generate an agenda** (or add one manually)
4. **Click "Create Board"** to generate a Miro board
5. **Click "Open Board"** to view/edit in Miro
6. **Click "Analyze"** to extract insights from the board

## 🐛 Debugging Notes

- Added extensive logging to MiroService constructor and board creation
- Server logs will show Miro API calls and responses
- Test scripts available:
  - `debug-miro.js` - Direct Miro API testing
  - `test-server-miro.js` - Server endpoint testing

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Final testing of server integration
2. Error handling improvements
3. Template copying functionality (currently creates empty boards)
4. Enhanced board content analysis
5. Integration with Trello for action items
