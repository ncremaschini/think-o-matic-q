## Revolutionary AI-Powered Workshop Management Tool "Think-o-matic" Transforms How Teams Plan, Execute, and Follow Up on Collaborative Sessions

### New Open-Source Platform Integrates Amazon Bedrock AI, Miro, and Trello to Streamline Entire Workshop Lifecycle from Planning to Action Item Completion

**Rivolta d'Adda, Italy, June 18, 2025** â€“ Today marks the launch of Think-o-matic ðŸ§ âš¡, an innovative AI-powered workshop management platform that revolutionizes how organizations plan, conduct, and follow up on collaborative sessions. This groundbreaking tool seamlessly integrates artificial intelligence with popular productivity platforms to eliminate the manual overhead that typically consumes 60-70% of workshop facilitators' time.

### The Workshop Management Challenge

Traditional workshop management is fragmented and time-consuming. Facilitators spend countless hours manually creating agendas, setting up collaboration boards, analyzing outcomes, and converting insights into actionable tasks across multiple disconnected tools. This inefficiency often leads to delayed follow-ups, lost insights, and reduced return on investment from collaborative sessions.

"We built Think-o-matic to automate the busywork so facilitators can focus on facilitation."
